# RideTheWake
An iOS application that tracks campus buses at universities. It is a great way to help students know where the shuttles are in realtime.

## Setup
Each shuttle is equiped with an iPad which contains a cellular connection. These iPads run an application that continously broadcasts the shuttle's location and information. The data is hosted on a simple webserver in XML files which are updated every 5 seconds. It is these XML files that we connect to for showing the shuttles in our application.
