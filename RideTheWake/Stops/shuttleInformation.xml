<!--

This is the main xml file for listing all the shuttle information needed throughout the app. This is a local file, not a server file.

Attributes:

- Name: This is the name of the shuttle line.

- Category: This indicates if the shuttle runs at nighttime or daytime. Use "day" for daytime shuttles, and "night" for nighttime shuttles.

- id: This is the reference to the shuttle files throughout the app for each line. For an example, "black" is inserted into "***Stops.csv" to say "blackStops.csv" in the mapViewController.

- stops: This is a list of all the stops that the shuttle makes. It is used for the main view under the name of the line. Keep the list of stops short and add "and more..." if there are too many.

- mapViewInitialZoomLevel: This is the zoom level of the Google Maps when it loads for each route in the mapViewController. The map is zoomed to a level so that the users can see the entire route.

- mapViewCenterCoordinateLat: This is the latitutde coordinate for the center of the map for each route. It is used to center the map on the route when the map loads for each route so that the user can see the entire route.

- mapViewCenterCoordinateLon: This is the latitutde coordinate for the center of the map for each route. It is used to center the map on the route when the map loads for each route.

- serverShuttleURL: This is the id for the URL to get the shuttle coordinates off the server. For an example, if "black" is used, then "shuttle.cs.wfu.edu/black.xml" is loaded.
 
- timeShuttleStarts: This is the time that the shuttle starts service. Use 24 hour clock. It helps us tell the user when the shuttle is running or not.
 
- timeShuttleEnds: This is the time that the shuttle ends its service. Use 24 hour clock. It helps us tell the user when the shuttle is running or not.
